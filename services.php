                 <h4>Pre Construction</h4><br>
                 <p>Pre construction services are preliminary planning and engineering services that are offered by construction companies before a construction job even begins. This pre construction planning stage involves the definition of the project, the identification of potential issues, planning and scheduling, the scope, cost estimation, and analysis of needs for the job.

Good pre construction will help a client decide if they can follow through with the construction project. They may find during this pre construction phase that the work is either too expensive, or not feasible for the space they have. If the contractor and client agree work to be done is viable, the contractor will then provide the client with a cost and schedule for the construction project.</p>

                 <h4>Architectural Modeling</h4><br>
                 <p>An architectural model is a type of scale model – a physical representation of a structure – built to study aspects of an architectural design or to communicate design ideas.

Depending on the purpose, models can be made from a variety of materials, including blocks, paper, and wood, and at a variety of scales.
Architectural models have been in use since pre-history. The oldest models were found in Malta, such as at Tarxien Temples, and are now at the archaeology museum in Valletta</p>

                 <h4>Construction Management</h4><br>
                 <p>Construction management is a professional service that provides a project’s owner(s) with effective management of the project's schedule, cost, quality, safety, scope, and function. Construction management is compatible with all project delivery methods. No matter the setting, a Construction Manager’s (CMs) responsibility is to the owner and to a successful project.</p>

                 <h4>ResidentialConstruction</h4><br>
                 <p>Residential construction may be undertaken by individual land-owners (self-build), by specialist house-builders, by property developers, by general contractors, or by providers of public or social housing (eg: local authorities, housing associations). Where local zoning or planning policies allow, mixed-use developments may comprise both residential and non-residential construction (eg: retail, leisure, offices, public buildings, etc)</p>

Most construction in these sectors is undertaken by general contractors.</p>
